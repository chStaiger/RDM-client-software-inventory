# RDM-client-software-inventory

This repository is setup to exchange experiences with clients for various RDM solutions. The scope is intentionally broad: client types may include file-transfer clients, sync clients, virtual file systems or command line tools using different protocols: WebDAV, iRODS, etc. We primarily target RDM solutions such as Yoda, iRODS and Research Drive, but feel please free to submit other reports of possible interest.
